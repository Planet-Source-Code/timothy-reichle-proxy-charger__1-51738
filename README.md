## Proxy Charger


</div>

### Description

This program is kind of a steping stone between a proxy server and a client. It allows you to charge people to use the proxy server.

There is an area to put an encryption method in. But as I don't want to give mine away , you will have to add it in. mdlCode.bas is where you put it (encode function and decode function)

The options for users are

->How much to charge per hour

->If there a piggyback user (needs to be someone else online)
